//loop from 0 to 360 degrees and output corresponding runway numbers

//variables
Keep track of a numerical variable named 'counter 1' starting at zero
Keep track of a numerical variable named 'counter 2' starting at 18
keep track of a numerical variable named 'counter 3' starting at 36
keep track of a numerical variable named 'number 1'

while (counter 1 is less that 360 loop the following steps)
{
	
	display("A runway facing " + (value of counter 1) + " degrees will have runway numbers " + ('counter 2') + "/" + ('counter 3')
	
	
	divide counter 1 by ten and store this new number into 'number 1'
	add 0.5 to 'number 1'
	truncate the decimal places in the value 'number 1'

	if 'number 1' is less than 19 than
	{
	let 'counter 2' equal 'number 1'
	let 'counter 3' equal 'counter 2' added by 18
	}
	
	else
	{
	let 'counter 2' equal 'number 1' subbtracted by 18
	let 'counter 3' equal 'counter 2' added by 18
	}

	add 17 to counter 1
